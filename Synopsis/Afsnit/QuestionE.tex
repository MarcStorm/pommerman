\section{E}
Each step of the algorithm will be analyzed in terms of their running time. First we will look at the running time for one iteration of the algorithm.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item To set a variable is an atomic action, $O(1)$.
    \item To select one edge takes constant time, so to select $n-1$ edges takes $O(n-1) = O(n)$.
    \item To check that the edges create a spanning tree can be done with a BFS, which takes $O(n+m)$.
    \item To calculate weight of all the edges in the spanning tree takes $O(n-1) = O(n)$ time and the time to find the weight of the mirror of an edge takes constant time. So the weight the mirror of the tree can be calculated in $O(n)$ time. In total the time for this step takes $O(n)$.
    \item Comparison of two values and to set a variable take constant time, $O(1)$.
    \item Comparison of two values and to set a variable take constant time, $O(1)$.
\end{enumerate}
The algorithm will continue until all combinations for choosing $n-1$ edges in the graph have been checked, which takes $O\left(\frac{m!}{(n-1)!\cdot(m-(n-1))!}\right)$.
